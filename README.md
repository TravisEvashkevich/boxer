How to Quickly draw Polygons and go from Frame to Frame
1. Go to the animation you want to draw polys on
2. Select a Polygroup and polygon
3. Draw your polygon by being in Polygon mode (P)
*IMPORTANT SPEEDY TIP*
4. When you are ready to start your next Polygon CLICK the Middle Mouse button.  This will Automatically create and select a new polygon within the current polygroup
5. Repeat 3-4 as needed. 
6. When you are done drawing polys in that frame and are ready to go to the next frame of Animation, (while having Polygroup OR a Polygon Selected) Hit Enter (numpad OR regular) 
and this will put you on the next frame in the same polygroup (if possible) as you were in the "previous" frame and on the first polygon so you can immediately continue making polygons
(repeating steps 3-4)
